# semdiff (or semantic diff)

A tool which can diff C# code semantically, rather than simply by the program's text.

This project aims to make developers aware of when they can do the following:

1. Cause a merge conflict when their code doesn't change any logic in the program
2. Merge in code which was written under different semantics

The goal of this project is to ultimately save significant time for large projects.
